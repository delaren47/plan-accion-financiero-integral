## COLD OUTREACH - RESTAURANTES

### Subject Line Options (A/B Test)
- "3 mejoras para aumentar reservas esta semana"
- "¿Pierdes clientes por no responder WhatsApp a tiempo?"
- "Restaurantes en {{City}} aumentan ventas 30% con esto"

### Email Body (English)

```
Hi {{FirstName}},

I noticed {{RestaurantName}} has great reviews on Google, but I saw an opportunity to capture more reservations.

Most restaurants lose 40% of potential reservations because:
- WhatsApp messages go unanswered after hours
- Phone calls go to voicemail during rush
- Website doesn't have easy booking

I help restaurants in {{City}} fix this in 48-72 hours with:

1. **WhatsApp Auto-Responder** - Captures leads 24/7, sends menu/specials automatically
2. **AI Voice Agent** - Answers calls, takes reservations, handles common questions
3. **One-Click Booking Button** - On your website (if you don't have one)

**Quick win pricing:** $500-$1,500 depending on what you need.
**Timeline:** 48-72 hours from kickoff.

Would you be open to a 15-min call this week to see if this makes sense for {{RestaurantName}}?

Best,
Alfred

### Email Body (Español)

```
Hola {{FirstName}},

Vi que {{RestaurantName}} tiene excelentes reseñas en Google, pero noté una oportunidad para capturar más reservaciones.

La mayoría de restaurantes pierden 40% de reservaciones potenciales porque:
- Mensajes de WhatsApp quedan sin respuesta fuera de horario
- Llamadas van a buzón durante horas pico
- Sitio web no tiene reservación fácil

Ayudo a restaurantes en {{City}} a resolver esto en 48-72 horas con:

1. **Auto-Respuesta WhatsApp** - Captura leads 24/7, envía menú/especiales automáticamente
2. **Agente de Voz IA** - Contesta llamadas, toma reservas, responde preguntas comunes
3. **Botón de Reserva Rápida** - En tu sitio web (si no tienes uno)

**Precio de implementación rápida:** $500-$1,500 según lo que necesites.
**Timeline:** 48-72 horas desde el inicio.

¿Estarías abierto a una llamada de 15 minutos esta semana para ver si tiene sentido para {{RestaurantName}}?

Saludos,
Alfred

## COLD OUTREACH - CLINICAS

### Subject Line Options
- "Pacientes perdidos por no responder WhatsApp rápido"
- "3 formas de reducir no-shows en {{ClinicName}}"
- "Clínicas en {{City}} automatizan recordatorios y agendan más citas"

### Email Body (English)

```
Hi Dr. {{LastName}},

I help medical practices reduce no-shows and capture more patient appointments without adding staff.

I noticed {{ClinicName}} could benefit from:

1. **Automated Appointment Reminders** (WhatsApp + SMS + Email)
   - Reduces no-shows by 60%+
   - Patients confirm with 1 click

2. **24/7 Appointment Scheduling** (AI Voice + Online Booking)
   - Patients book outside business hours
   - Reduces front desk workload

3. **Patient Intake Automation**
   - Digital forms sent before appointment
   - Saves 10-15 min per patient

**Investment:** $1,000-$2,000 one-time setup
**ROI:** Typical client sees 20+ additional appointments/month = $4,000-$10,000 additional revenue

Would you be open to a brief call to discuss how this could work for {{ClinicName}}?

Best regards,
Alfred

## COLD OUTREACH - ECOMMERCE

### Subject Line Options
- "Carritos abandonados = $XXX perdidos cada mes"
- "E-commerce stores using this get 25% more sales"
- "¿Respondes DMs de Instagram a las 11pm?"

### Email Body (English)

```
Hi {{FirstName}},

Quick question: How many people add items to cart on {{StoreName}} but never check out?

Industry average is 70%. That's potential revenue walking away.

I help e-commerce stores recover abandoned carts and increase conversions with:

1. **WhatsApp Cart Recovery** - Automated messages with discount code for abandoned carts
2. **Instagram DM Bot** - Answers product questions 24/7, shares checkout links
3. **AI Product Recommender** - "You might also like..." personalized for each customer

**Case Study:** Similar store ($50K/month) added $12K monthly revenue with these tools.

**Investment:** $1,500-$3,000 depending on complexity
**Timeline:** 72 hours from kickoff

Interested in a 15-min call to see if this makes sense for {{StoreName}}?

Cheers,
Alfred

## FOLLOW-UP 1 (DÍA 3)

### Subject Line
- "Re: [Original Subject]"
- "Quick follow-up - {{FirstName}}"

### Email Body

```
Hi {{FirstName}},

Just following up on my email from {{DayOfWeek}} about [specific pain point, e.g., "WhatsApp automation for {{RestaurantName}}"].

I know you're busy, so I'll keep this short:

**What I'm offering:** [1-sentence description of solution]
**What it costs:** $[Range]
**How long it takes:** 48-72 hours
**What you get:** [Specific outcome, e.g., "24/7 lead capture without hiring staff"]

If this isn't a priority right now, no worries - just let me know and I won't follow up again.

But if it sounds interesting, would {{DayNextWeek}} or {{DayNextWeek+1}} work for a quick 15-min call?

Best,
Alfred

## FOLLOW-UP 2 (DÍA 7)

### Subject Line
- "Last try - {{FirstName}}"
- "Is this a bad time?"

### Email Body

```
{{FirstName}},

I've reached out twice about [solution] for {{CompanyName}}, but haven't heard back.

I'm guessing one of three things is happening:

1. **Not interested** → Totally fine, just let me know so I stop bothering you
2. **Interested but buried** → Reply with "later" and I'll check back in a month
3. **Interested but need more info** → What questions can I answer?

Either way, I'd appreciate knowing where you stand so I can plan accordingly.

Thanks,
Alfred

P.S. - If you're not the right person for this, who should I talk to?
```

## FOLLOW-UP 3 (DÍA 14 - BREAKUP)

### Subject Line
- "Breaking up is hard to do"
- "Closing your file - {{FirstName}}"

### Email Body

```
Hi {{FirstName}},

I'm closing your file since I haven't heard back after a few attempts.

Before I do, I wanted to share one last thing that might be relevant:

[Share a specific insight, case study, or free resource related to their pain point]

Example: "A restaurant in {{City}} just added $8K/month in revenue by automating WhatsApp reservations - here's how they did it: [link to 1-pager case study]"

If you ever want to revisit this conversation, my door is always open.

Best of luck with {{CompanyName}},
Alfred

**P.S.** - If you know someone else who might benefit from [solution], I'd appreciate the intro. I pay 20% referral fees for closed deals.

## POST-DELIVERY: RETAINER UPSELL

### Subject Line
- "What's next for {{CompanyName}}?"
- "Idea: Monthly retainer for {{CompanyName}}"

### Email Body

```
Hi {{FirstName}},

I'm glad [project name] is working well for {{CompanyName}}!

I've been thinking about what else we could tackle together on an ongoing basis.

A lot of my clients transition to a **monthly retainer** after a successful fast win because it gives them:
- **Predictable support** - I'm always available for questions, tweaks, updates
- **Continuous improvement** - We keep optimizing and adding features
- **Priority access** - You're first in line when you need something

**Here's what a retainer could look like for {{CompanyName}}:**

**Option 1: Maintenance & Support** - $500/month
- Monitor systems (WhatsApp bot, AI agent, etc.)
- Fix bugs/issues within 24 hours
- Monthly performance report
- Up to 5 hours/month of updates/tweaks

**Option 2: Growth & Optimization** - $1,000/month
- Everything in Option 1, plus:
- A/B testing to improve conversions
- New feature development (10 hours/month)
- Monthly strategy call

**Option 3: Full-Service Partner** - $1,500/month
- Everything in Option 2, plus:
- Dedicated Slack channel for instant support
- 20 hours/month of development/strategy
- Quarterly roadmap planning

**No long-term contract required** - Month-to-month, cancel anytime.

Does one of these options make sense for where {{CompanyName}} is headed?

Let's jump on a quick call to discuss: [Calendly link]

Best,
Alfred

## PAYMENT REMINDER: FINAL

**(Send 7 days after due date if still unpaid)**

### Subject Line
- "URGENT: Invoice {{InvoiceNumber}} now 7 days overdue"
- "Final notice: Invoice {{InvoiceNumber}}"

### Email Body

```
{{FirstName}},

Invoice #{{InvoiceNumber}} for ${{Amount}} is now **7 days overdue** (original due date: {{DueDate}}).

I've reached out multiple times and haven't received payment or a response.

**Outstanding Amount:** ${{Amount}} + ${{LateFee}} late fee = **${{TotalWithLateFee}}**

Per our agreement, invoices unpaid after 30 days are subject to:
- 1.5% monthly late fee
- Suspension of services
- Referral to collections

**I'd prefer to avoid that.** If there's a payment issue, let's discuss it now so we can work out a plan.

**To avoid further action, please:**
1. Remit payment immediately via [Zelle/Wire/Stripe]
2. Or reply to this email with a payment plan proposal by {{Deadline}}

Thanks,
Alfred
Delaren Consulting LLC

---

**IMPORTANT:** If I don't hear from you by {{Deadline}}, I will have no choice but to refer this to collections and report the delinquency. I really don't want to do that, so please respond.

## USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

### How to Use These Templates

1. **Personalize every email** - Replace all {{variables}} with real data

3. **Track in CRM** - Log every email sent in `ops/crm_simple.csv`
4. **Measure response rates** - Target >10% response on cold emails, >30% on follow-ups
5. **Adjust based on data** - If response rate <5%, rewrite cold email approach

### Variables to Customize

- `{{FirstName}}` - Prospect's first name
- `{{LastName}}` - Prospect's last name

- `{{City}}` - City/location
- `{{DayOfWeek}}` - e.g., "Monday"

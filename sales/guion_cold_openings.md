## PRE-CALL PREPARATION

### Before You Dial (2 minutes)

1. **Research the prospect:**
   - Google their business (website, reviews, social media)
   - Identify 1 specific pain point you can solve
   - Find their first name (use "Hi, is [FirstName] available?")

2. **Set your intention:**
   - Goal: Get 15-min discovery call scheduled
   - NOT: Sell on this call
   - NOT: Explain every feature

3. **Prepare your CRM:**
   - Have `ops/crm_simple.csv` open to log call results immediately
   - Note lead's phone number, company, and any pre-call research

4. **Mindset:**
   - Smile while talking (they can hear it)
   - Stand up (more energy)
   - Expect rejection (10% connect rate is normal)

## SCRIPT: RESTAURANTES

### Opening Hook (English)

```
YOU: "Hi [Name], this is Alfred from Delaren Consulting.
      Did I catch you at a bad time?"

PROSPECT: "No, go ahead." / "Who is this?"

YOU: "I help restaurants in [City] capture more reservations
      without hiring more staff. Do you have 30 seconds for me
      to explain how?"

PROSPECT: "Okay..." [or hangs up - that's fine, next call]

YOU: "Great. We set up three things in 48-72 hours:

      1. WhatsApp bot that responds to reservation requests 24/7
      2. AI voice agent that answers calls when you're slammed
      3. One-click booking on your website

      A restaurant similar to yours added $8K monthly revenue
      with these tools.

      Quick question: How are you currently handling
      reservations when you're busy during dinner rush?"

[LISTEN TO THEIR ANSWER]

YOU: "Got it. And what happens to the people who call when
      all your lines are busy or after hours?"

[LISTEN]

YOU: "That's exactly the problem we solve. Based on what
      you're telling me, I think we could help [RestaurantName]
      capture those lost reservations.

      Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call on Thursday
      or Friday to explore if this makes sense?"

[IF YES]
YOU: "Perfect! Do you prefer morning or afternoon?"
[Book the meeting, send calendar invite immediately]

[IF NO/OBJECTION]
See objection handling below
```

### Opening Hook (Español)

```
TÚ: "Hola [Nombre], soy Alfred de Delaren Consulting.
     ¿Te agarré en mal momento?"

PROSPECTO: "No, dime." / "¿De qué se trata?"

TÚ: "Ayudo a restaurantes en [Ciudad] a capturar más
     reservaciones sin contratar más personal.
     ¿Tienes 30 segundos para que te explique cómo?"

PROSPECTO: "Dale..." [o cuelga - está bien, siguiente llamada]

TÚ: "Perfecto. Configuramos tres cosas en 48-72 horas:

     1. Bot de WhatsApp que responde solicitudes de reserva 24/7
     2. Agente de voz IA que contesta llamadas cuando estás saturado
     3. Botón de reserva rápida en tu sitio web

     Un restaurante similar al tuyo agregó $8K mensuales de
     ingresos con estas herramientas.

     Pregunta rápida: ¿Cómo manejas actualmente las reservaciones
     cuando estás ocupado en hora pico?"

[ESCUCHA SU RESPUESTA]

TÚ: "Entiendo. ¿Y qué pasa con las personas que llaman cuando
     todas tus líneas están ocupadas o después del horario?"

[ESCUCHA]

TÚ: "Exactamente ese es el problema que resolvemos. Basado en
     lo que me dices, creo que podríamos ayudar a [NombreRestaurante]
     a capturar esas reservaciones perdidas.

     ¿Estarías abierto a una llamada rápida de 15 minutos el
     jueves o viernes para ver si tiene sentido?"

[SI SÍ]
TÚ: "¡Perfecto! ¿Prefieres por la mañana o por la tarde?"
[Agéndala, envía invitación de calendario inmediatamente]

[SI NO/OBJECIÓN]

## SCRIPT: CLÍNICAS/MEDICAL

### Opening Hook

```
YOU: "Hi Dr. [LastName], this is Alfred from Delaren Consulting.
      Did I catch you at a bad time?"

PROSPECT: "I'm with a patient." / "What's this about?"

YOU: "I'll be quick. I help medical practices reduce no-shows
      and fill more appointments without adding front desk staff.
      Do you have 30 seconds?"

PROSPECT: "Go ahead."

YOU: "We set up automated appointment reminders via WhatsApp,
      text, and email - plus 24/7 online scheduling so patients
      can book when they think of it.

      Typical clinic sees 60% fewer no-shows and 20 more
      appointments per month.

      Quick question: What's your current no-show rate?"

[LISTEN]

YOU: "And how do patients currently book appointments -
      only during business hours by calling?"

[LISTEN]

YOU: "Got it. So you're losing patients who think about booking
      at 9pm but can't reach anyone until tomorrow, and by then
      they've forgotten or gone somewhere else."

[PAUSE - Let them agree]

YOU: "Based on what you're telling me, this could easily add
      $4K-$10K monthly revenue to [ClinicName] just by reducing
      no-shows and capturing after-hours bookings.

      Would you be open to a 15-minute call this week to see
      the numbers for your specific practice?"

[IF YES → Schedule]
[IF NO → Objection handling]
```

## SCRIPT: E-COMMERCE

### Opening Hook

```
YOU: "Hi [Name], this is Alfred from Delaren Consulting.
      Did I catch you at a bad time?"

PROSPECT: "Depends - what's this about?"

YOU: "I help e-commerce stores recover abandoned carts and
      increase conversions without spending more on ads.
      Do you have 30 seconds?"

PROSPECT: "Sure."

YOU: "Great. Quick question first: About how many people add
      items to cart on [StoreName] but don't check out?"

[LISTEN - Most will say "I don't know" or "Too many"]

YOU: "Industry average is 70%. That's potential revenue walking away.

      We set up three automations in 72 hours:

      1. WhatsApp messages for abandoned carts with discount code
      2. Instagram DM bot that answers questions 24/7
      3. AI product recommender for upsells

      A store doing $50K/month added $12K with these tools.

      Are you currently doing anything to recover those
      abandoned carts?"

[LISTEN]

YOU: "Based on what you're telling me, I think we could add
      $5K-$15K monthly revenue to [StoreName] pretty easily.

      Would you be open to a quick call Thursday or Friday
      to run the numbers for your store specifically?"

[IF YES → Schedule]
[IF NO → Objection handling]
```

## SCRIPT: GENERAL SMALL BUSINESS

### Opening Hook (When You Don't Know Their Industry Well)

```
YOU: "Hi [Name], this is Alfred from Delaren Consulting.
      Did I catch you at a bad time?"

PROSPECT: "What's this regarding?"

YOU: "I help small businesses automate lead capture and
      customer communication without hiring more people.
      Do you have 30 seconds?"

PROSPECT: "Go ahead."

YOU: "Quick question: Are you currently using WhatsApp or
      text messaging to communicate with customers?"

[LISTEN]

YOU: "And when customers message you at 8pm or on Sunday,
      how do you handle that?"

[LISTEN - They'll usually say "I don't" or "I check whenever"]

YOU: "That's actually a huge opportunity. We set up automated
      responses that capture those leads 24/7 and qualify them
      for you.

      Most clients see 30-40% more leads converting just from
      responding instantly instead of hours later.

      Based on what you're telling me about [CompanyName],
      I think this could work really well.

      Would you be open to a 15-minute call this week to
      explore if it makes sense?"

[IF YES → Schedule]
[IF NO → Objection handling]
```

---

## OBJECIONES COMUNES + RESPONSES

### "We're not interested."

**Response:**
```
"Totally understand. Quick question before I let you go -
 is it not interesting because you're already handling
 [pain point] well, or just not a priority right now?"

[LISTEN]

If "Already handling it well":
  "Great to hear! Out of curiosity, what are you using?"
  [They'll explain, then you can highlight gaps if any]

If "Not a priority":
  "Got it. When would be a better time to revisit this -
   in a month or next quarter?"
  [Get permission to follow up]
```

---

### "How much does it cost?"

**Response:**
```
"Great question. It depends on exactly what you need, but
 typically ranges from $500 to $2,000 for the initial setup.

 The reason there's a range is [industry] businesses have
 different needs - some just need WhatsApp automation, others
 need voice + WhatsApp + website booking.

 That's why I'd love to jump on a quick call to understand
 your specific situation and give you an exact quote.

 Would Thursday or Friday work for 15 minutes?"
```

---

### "Send me some information."

**Response (Don't Just Send Info - Get Meeting):**
```
"Happy to. I have a few different options depending on your
 situation, so I don't want to overwhelm you with irrelevant info.

 Can I ask you 2-3 quick questions right now so I send you
 the right stuff?"

[If YES → Ask discovery questions, then transition to meeting request]

[If NO → "No problem. I'll send you a quick overview email.
 What's the best email address?]
 [Send email with proposal template, follow up in 3 days]
```

---

### "I need to talk to my business partner / spouse / team."

**Response:**
```
"Absolutely, that makes total sense for a decision like this.

 Would it make sense to include them on our 15-minute call
 so we can all discuss it together? That way everyone's
 questions get answered at once.

 What's their schedule like - could we do a call Thursday
 afternoon or Friday morning with both of you?"

[If they push back: "No problem. When should I follow up
 after you've had a chance to discuss?"]
```

---

### "We don't have the budget right now."

**Response:**
```
"I totally get it - budget's always tight for small businesses.

 Quick question: If I could show you how this would pay for
 itself in the first month, would budget still be an issue?

 [LISTEN]

 The reason I ask is most of my clients see [specific ROI,
 e.g., '20 more appointments per month'] which more than
 covers the $1,000-$2,000 investment.

 Would it make sense to at least explore the numbers on a
 quick call to see if the ROI works? If it doesn't make
 financial sense, I'll be the first to tell you."
```

---

### "Call me back in [time period]."

**Response:**
```
"Absolutely. Just so I'm prepared for that call, can I ask -
 what's happening in [time period] that makes it a better time?"

[LISTEN - This reveals if it's a real timeline or a brush-off]

If real timeline:
  "Perfect. I'll put a note to call you on [specific date].
   Would morning or afternoon be better?"

If brush-off:
  "No problem. If things change sooner, feel free to reach
   out. I'll send you my email in case you want to follow up
   before then."
```

---

### "We tried something like this before and it didn't work."

**Response:**
```
"I'm sorry to hear that. Can I ask what you tried and what
 didn't work about it?"

[LISTEN - This gives you a chance to differentiate]

"Got it. The reason we're different is [specific differentiator].

 But I don't want you to take my word for it. Would you be
 open to a quick 15-minute call where I can show you exactly
 how we'd approach it for [CompanyName] and you can decide
 if it's different enough to be worth trying?"
```

---

### "I'm too busy right now."

**Response:**
```
"I totally understand - that's exactly why I think this could
 help. The whole point is to save you time by automating
 [specific task].

 Quick question: How much time are you spending right now on
 [pain point, e.g., 'responding to WhatsApp messages' or
 'chasing down no-show patients']?"

[LISTEN]

"So if I could get that down to 10 minutes a day instead of
 [X hours], would that be worth a 15-minute conversation?"

[Usually they'll agree when you frame it as time-saving]
```

---

## CALL TRACKING & KPIS

### Log Every Call in CRM

Immediately after each call, update `ops/crm_simple.csv` with:
- Date/time of call
- Outcome: Scheduled Meeting | Send Info | Call Back Later | Not Interested | No Answer
- Next action: Follow-up date or meeting date
- Notes: Key pain points mentioned, objections raised

### Track These KPIs Daily

Add to `ops/actividades_diarias.csv`:
- **Calls made:** Total dials
- **Conversations:** Got past gatekeeper/voicemail
- **Meetings scheduled:** Booked discovery call
- **Conversion rate:** Meetings / Conversations (target: >20%)

### Weekly Review

Every Friday, calculate:
- **Dial-to-conversation rate:** Should be >30% (if lower, you're calling wrong people)
- **Conversation-to-meeting rate:** Should be >20% (if lower, refine script)
- **Meeting-to-proposal rate:** Should be >50% (tracked in later stages)

---

## BEST PRACTICES

### DO:
- ✅ Smile while talking (they can hear it)
- ✅ Use their first name 2-3 times in conversation
- ✅ Ask permission before pitching ("Do you have 30 seconds?")
- ✅ Listen more than you talk (60/40 ratio)
- ✅ Be specific about outcomes ("20 more appointments" not "grow your business")
- ✅ End with clear CTA ("Thursday or Friday?")
- ✅ Log call results immediately in CRM

### DON'T:
- ❌ Apologize for calling ("Sorry to bother you")
- ❌ Ask "How are you?" (waste of time, they know it's sales)
- ❌ Explain every feature (save for discovery call)
- ❌ Argue when they say no (just move to next call)
- ❌ Leave voicemails on first call (low ROI, send email instead)
- ❌ Call without researching their business first
